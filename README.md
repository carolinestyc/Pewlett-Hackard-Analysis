# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
Bobby, an HR Analysist and Pewlett Hackard, has asked for my help exploring the numbers for upcoming retirements. PH was using Excel and VBA and have begun the transition to SQL so the data we have is in 6 different csv sheets/tables. Bringing this data into SQL, PH wants to know how many employees will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions they will need to fill. Looking at the future, the boomer generation is on the way out and they need to be prepapred for the change in employee supply.
